# Hi there, I'm **Elsabeth Eyayu**! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineering** student at **Bahirdar University (BDU)**, passionate about learning how systems work from the inside out. I enjoy exploring everything from **Linux-based operating systems** to **low-level system programming in C**.

-  I love solving problems and understanding the "why" behind how things work.
-  I'm passionate about building my skills as a future software engineer and discovering where I can grow and contribute.
