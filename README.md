# Hi there, I'm Elsabeth Eyayu! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering student at **Bahirdar University (BDU)**, passionate about learning how systems work from the inside out. I enjoy exploring everything from Linux-based operating systems to low-level system programming in C.
-  I love solving problems and understanding the "why" behind how things work.
-  I'm passionate about building my skills as a future software engineer and discovering where I can grow and contribute.
-  "The best way to learn is by doing, and the best way to grow is by sharing."
- Thanks for visiting my profile âœ¨
